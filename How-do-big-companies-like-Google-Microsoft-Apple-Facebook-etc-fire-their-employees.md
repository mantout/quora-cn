# 大公司是怎么解雇员工的？

I have always been fascinated by how great it is to working on big companies (like Google, Apple, Facebook, Quora, Microsoft, etc.) but I'm also curious about how they fire their employees? How long is the process? Do they've got any tricks to make it painless?

我一直希望进入像谷歌、苹果、脸书、Quora、微软等这样的大公司工作，同时我也很好奇他们是怎么解雇员工的，这个过程长吗？有哪些坑要绕开的？

## 回答正文

L. Mary Dagan-Föxman, I have several successful/established startups under my belt. 1 failure.

L. Mary Dagan-Föxman，成功创办过几家创业公司，失败了一次。

Although I was never fired, I am aware of how the process works at several large tech corporations:

尽管我还没有失业过，但我是知道一点大公司解雇员工的流程。

### THE TYPICAL FIRING SCENARIO: 典型场景：

Large corporations prefer to fire employees on Friday's, soon after the start time of the employees work day.

大公司喜欢在周五解雇员工，一般是在上班后不久。

* Friday morning. •周五早晨

* Employee goes to his/her desk and powers up their computer. •员工来到工作台前，打开电脑

* Employee has been unsuccessful in attempting to log-on to their workstation account. •员工发现自己无法登录系统

* In-house IT personnel receives notification of unsuccessful log-in attempts and calls HR dept. •内部IT部门收到登录失败提醒，并通知人力

* HR staff member asks employee to meet with them "to have a talk". •人力部门请员工去“聊一聊”

* The meeting will be with the employee, the HR staff member, and (typically) a member of the Legal dept.•人力、法务部门的职员都会出席

* HR staff member explains to employee the reason(s) WHY he/she is being "terminated".•人力向员工解释工作被“终止”的原因

* HR staff member and/or staff security will escort the (now former) employee to his/her (now former) workstation to collect their personal belongings and then escort the person out of the building.•人力和/或保安陪同员工——现在是前员工了——去他的工作台收拾个人物品，并护送他离开公司

### IMMEDIATE FIRING: 就地解职：

I once witnessed a very brutal altercation in the office where a male staff member (experienced martial artist) approached a female staff member who was seated at her workstation,  facing her PC monitor from behind and began choking her which lead to him repeatedly punching her in the head.

我曾见过一次非常恐怖的打架。一名练过武术的男员工从身后靠近一名面对着电脑屏幕的女员工，一只手勒住她的脖子，另一只手不停地击打她的头部。

He was immediately escorted off of the property by staff security and was immediately fired due to the severity of his workplace outburst.

保安立即将男员工押送出大楼，男员工因为严重的打架事件被当场开除。

## 评论：

Uzi Kilon: I was never fired, but I know as a fact that in most cases the employee was on a "performance plan" for at least a month prior to termination, and is getting the notice in person from his manager. Nobody would want to work for a company where this is a typical process. 

我从没被解雇过。但据我所知，大多数情况下，公司裁员是根据“绩效计划”来进行的。被解雇员工的经理至少会提前一个月告之。哪个愿意在你说的“典型场景”的公司里工作？

Jack Simpson: I don't think the first time HR knows about an employee being fired is after IT has turned off their login access. It would be HR telling IT to do this in the first place.

我觉得人力应该先于IT部门知道员工被解雇的消息，要不然IT部门怎么会知道收回哪个员工的登录权限。

Jackie Aldridge: I'm surprised the martial artist wasn't arrested and tried.

练家子竟然没有抓起来判刑，真是太神奇了！

David J. Cheney: "Although I was never fired, I am aware of how the process works." Sounds like you know less than half of how the process works.

“尽管我没有失业过，但我还是知道一点大公司解雇员工的流程。”听起来你不清楚解雇是怎么一回事吧！

Abir Roychoudhury: Have your own startup.  Work for a company - you put your family's destiny in someone else's hands. When you work for someone, you are always replaceable, like staples - there's always another one !

还是自己创业吧。给别人打工，就是将自己的命运寄托在别人的手中，大家都是螺丝钉，没有谁是不可替换的。
