# 外国人怎么看你的国家之俄罗斯

## 回答

I live abroad for 6 years, and majority of my non-USSR friends still see Russia in quite stereotypical manner.

我在国外生活了6年，绝大多数非苏联朋友对俄罗斯都抱有一些刻板的看法。

So let's take a look at most typical images people describe when they ask me things about mother Russia (Russian Internet, big thanks for the pics).

下面让我们来看看人们描述我的祖国俄罗斯时典型的画面吧（图片来自俄罗斯百度，一百个谢！）

I'd say come and see for yourself how different Russia is from anything you imagined. Welcome to Russia!

我不得不说，亲身来俄罗斯体验一下吧，一定会超乎你的想像。俄罗斯欢迎你！

Tim Breen:

Very interesting! As an American born during the Cold War years, I've heard of some of these stereotypes, but not others. Typical attitudes I've seen would be:

太有意思了！我是出生在冷战时期的美国人，上面提到的一些成见我基本上都听说过，我也碰到过这样一些看法：

Vodka. Russians are thought to drink a lot of vodka, but not necessarily with meals. I've thought it was a weekend/evening thing. That's the time that "binge drinking" tends to occur in the US.

伏特加：俄罗斯人爱喝酒，而且不一定非要在吃饭时喝。我曾经以为他们有点类似“周末聚会”或者“晚上加餐”一类的性质，美国人往往会在这种场合下喝个烂醉。

Bears. Never really heard much about actual bears, but have heard Russia itself described as "the bear."

熊：没见过真正的熊，但是俄罗斯老是自诩为 “熊”。

Cold. I've always heard it's really cold in places like Moscow and Siberia in the winter.  I never really hear anything about summer, or places further south or west.

冷：常听说莫斯科和西伯利亚的冬天冷得出奇，但是俄罗斯没有夏天吗？俄罗斯的南部和西部也这么冷吗？

Women. Beautiful, yes. I've never heard them described as "traditional," though. (To be fair, all women are beautiful if you look at them with the right perspective.)

女人：漂亮，杠杠的！但是“传统”就不一定了。（当然了，所有女人都漂亮，情人眼里出西施嘛）

Putin. I've never heard that he was passionately supported by the Russian people. The popular perception that I've seen here is that he's simply the one that was able to grab the most power.

普京：我从没听说过俄罗斯人全民狂热地支持他，一种比较流行的看法是说普京仅仅只是一个拥有最高权力的人而已。

Crime. This wasn't on your list, but the perception here is that crime in the big cities is significant, and tourists can do little to protect themselves alone. The recommendation is to travel with established tour groups, or visit the countryside instead.

犯罪：这一点不在你列出的几点当中，但感觉是这样的。大城市的犯罪率很高，只身出行的游客根本无法保护自己，推荐跟团游或者到偏远乡村旅游。

All that said, I've never visited Russia but would really like to one day, budget permitting. But I expect I'd try to go in the spring/summer, and to meet lots of people in the countryside. ;-)

说了这么多，其实我从没有去过俄罗斯，当然我非常愿意去玩一次，只要钱包允许。我打算春天或者夏天去一趟，去乡村玩，结交一下当地人。


Ti Tim - crime stuff is actually kinda true, for example, you should be in control of your personal belongings in public transportation and be careful if you decided to take a walk in the middle of the night, however, it is not like you cannot step outside without being robbed or beaten up - not at all. 

And if you scream: "Help!" people will actually come and help you out, not like in China where I live now.

回复 Tim：犯罪问题，只能说部分是事实。乘坐公共交通工具时，你要保护好自己的个人财物，深夜出门最好是多加小心。但是，并不是你想像中那样出门就被抢或者被人暴揍一顿，绝对不是这样的。

只要你大喊救命，自然会有上前来帮你，这跟我生活过的中国完全不一样。（mantout：题主这样黑中国，还自认为是China Lover，真不害臊，还好有一个叫 Lucy Zhang的中国妹子表达了不一样的意见）

Matti Porkka:

I still miss that my chance to study at Russia when I was a teenager blew up on the last minute. I also was going to take part in a space science camp at one of the Cosmodromes but that too dried up. But one day...

时至今日，我仍然十分怀念我小时候在俄罗斯学习的经历，那是在最后一刻才获得的机会，弥足珍贵。另此，我马上要参加在一个航天发射场举办的航空科技营，那个地方实在太干燥了。但是，说不定哪天（mantout：这哥们儿话没说完……）

Neil Highnam:

I find the heating in Russia unbearable. My girlfriend is Siberian and she's just been staying with me for 2 weeks. I wouldn't have switched on my heating at home as it's about 15 degrees but she insisted on it being on full blast.

我实在受不了俄罗斯的供暖系统。我有一个女朋友是西伯利亚人，处了两周就分了。原因就是开不开暖气，室内温度根本就不低，我不想开暖气，她却将供暖器打到最大。（mantout：开不开空调，开多少度，有多少夫妻为此开过战，举手！）

I've only been to Russia in winter and my hotel or apartments have been so hot I've had to open the windows for most of the time as I couldn't turn it down. Private apartments were the same. Strange considering how cold it is outside: you'd think that people wouldn't be so sensitive inside. 

我只在冬天到过俄罗斯，我住过的酒店、旅馆和公寓都将暖气开得高高的，还关不掉，我不得不将窗户打开透透气。我就好奇了，外面是有多冷啊，冻得他们都不知道什么是冷什么是热了。

Damon Bradley:

Russians are pretty damn murderous towards innocent civilians; look at Chechnya, Syria, and Ukraine for the most recent examples. God only KNOWS how many millions of people died in the gulags as well. Sadly Russians havent seemed to learned the value of non-slav lives.

俄罗斯人对平民真TM残忍，看看车臣、叙利亚和乌克兰的近况吧。天晓得有多少人死在集中营。可悲的是，俄罗斯人似乎根本没有意识到那些人不是他们的奴隶，珍惜一下他们的生命吧。（mantout：这哥们似乎很不待见俄罗斯，汗）

PC Haran:

I have been to Russia and vodka is most definitely a big part of the culture. I was offered vodka at nearly every lunch and dinner. It is also very cold in Moscow and most of the women were quite attractive I thought. Did not see any bears though .

我去过俄罗斯，伏特加绝对是他们文化当中重要的一部分，餐餐必供应伏特加。莫斯科很冷。大多数女人很有魅力。熊？没见过。

Aashish Bagdi:

now I will got to Russia.. I'll find a bear.. offer him a bottle of vodka (no I don't drink).. and make him my best friend .. then I'll pretend that I'm Mowgli !

我打算去趟俄罗斯，找到一头熊，给它一瓶伏特加(尽管我不喝酒)，假装我是狼人莫格利，跟它成为好朋友。（mantout：有才，把几个梗都串起来了）
